## HOW-TO-USE
Import the project directory into your local system. Once opened in the terminal, run the following script
```
cd client
yarn start
```
This will deploy the React Application onto your local system at `localhost:3000`.
<br>
Now, to start running the API, run the following script in a new terminal
```
cd api
nodemon index.js
```
This will initialise the `nodemon` library to keep updating the node.js application.
